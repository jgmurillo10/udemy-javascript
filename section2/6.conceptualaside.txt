Conceptual Aside
Syntax parsers:
A program that reads your codes and determines what it dows and if its grammar is valid


Execution contexts:
A wrapper to help manage the code that is running


Lexical environments:
Where something sits physically in the code you write
(where is written and what's surrounding)
